During this project, we evaluated the impact of the different legal decisions concerning COVID-19 on the general mood of the Belgians.

7,000,000 tweets were scrapped uniformly over the year 2019 and annotated by our model.

The model we used is a BERT-based pre-trained model calls CamemBERT on which we added our classification layers. 

To perform the fine-tuning, we used film commentaries scrapped from the allocine.fr website
